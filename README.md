- 👋 Hi, I'm Ben Yates. Thanks for looking at my Github profile!
#- 👀 I’m interested in - many many things. IT, coding, DevOps. Some popular physics, astronomy, car repairs are fun. Psychology. Earth history. Bit of philosophy.
#- 🌱 I’m currently learning GCP.
#- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing ATM. Throwing myself in head first into learning more.
